basically i have made is a door lock controlled by a 775 dc motor connected to a locking and unlocking mechanism with nut and bolt, a l298n motor driver, a arduino uno or any other compatable board, a rfid rc522 reader and tag, and a 12v power supply and a buck converter or a 5v power supply for the arduino uno. So with all of them together and with code in it which i have provided and you can check the wroking and the video on my youtube channel. :)
